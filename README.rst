Noe Nieto - Curriculum Vitae
============================

English
=======

This is my resume. I studied Electronics Engineering, but also have some
background in Computer Engineering, so I have to have two versions laying
around.

Feel free to look around. If you find some script or template useful, feel
free to copy it and adapt it to your own purposes. Just don't plagiarize my
personal information.

If you want to see how to use ``rst2pdf`` take a look at this cool guide:
http://osiux.com/howto-use-rst2pdf.txt

To rebuild the documents execute the ``build.sh`` script.
